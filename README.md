### Minilibx

You need minilibx installed to be able to play this game. Don't have it? 42Paris has a nice installation guide. It also provides some maps you can test around with.

### How to Play?

- You need to compile all source files with make all.
- To launch the game, execute `./so_long` with a map as argument:
`./so_long maps/map.ber`\
`./so_long maps/map2.ber`
